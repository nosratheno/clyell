### Ghost - Meliora (2015)

I really enjoy this album. It has the metal vibe that I appreciate, but I can also listen to it when my kids are around without feeling concerned about the overall harshness (as I listen to metal almost exclusively). Start to finish, it is a __very__ easy album to digest.

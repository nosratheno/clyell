### Opeth - Blackwater Park (2001)

This was my introduction to Opeth. Sometime between 2004-5 I came across Blackwater Park, and it was an instant hit. I loved the melodies, the approachableness, the lengthy and interesting compositions--Opeth had a sound that was new to me. I listened to it, and everything else Opeth often, until I had to move on due to burnout. That took a few years. A friend of mine, Vidan, played *The Leper Affinity*, at our college talent night freshman year. I liked him. I don't listen as much to Opeth anymore, but their body of work has a solid spot in my forever rotation.

### Tool - Ænima (1996)

I had this album on tape. Carved Ænima's lyrics into my school desk. I was in year 10, and having a complicated time with my fading sight, and the rudderless-ness of being my own boss for the last few years. It's an album that gave me the means to generate self sustaining energy when I found I was otherwise drained.
